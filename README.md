# Logistic Regression Algorithm

# Introduction
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for binary classification that models the probability of an event occurring. It is widely used in predictive modeling tasks such as disease diagnosis, spam detection, and credit scoring.

# Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data before training the model.
2. Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression using scikit-learn.
3. Model Evaluation: Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

# Installation and Usage
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azkalltlhn/Gradient_Boosting_Classifier.git

2. **Install the required dependencies::**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

3. Run the notebook:
- Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Load the file Logistic_Regression_Azka_Lailatul_Hana.ipynb.
- Run all cells.

# Results and Evaluation
The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness.
